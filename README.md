# RegularExpressionParser (dotnet Core and Angular2+)
Regular Expression Parser

This is a simple implementation. More features can be added to this demo code if you want.
If you add more features to this demo code presented here, I would very much like to have a copy of that code if it is OK with you. 
I don't think it would be too difficult to port this demo code to C++ if you want.
